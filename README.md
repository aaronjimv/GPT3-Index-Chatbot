# GPT-3 Index Chatbot

This repository contains two scripts that together create a chatbot based on OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and a custom search index.

## Index Training (train.py)

The `train.py` script is responsible for training a search index using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. Here is a summary of the key steps in the process:

1. Load training documents from a directory named "datos".
2. Set parameters such as maximum input size, maximum token count, and chunk size.
3. Create a `PromptHelper` object to process queries and fragment the documents.
4. Create an `LLMPredictor` model with a pre-trained OpenAI model.
5. Create a service context using the model and the `PromptHelper`.
6. Train a `GPTVectorStoreIndex` using the documents and the service context.
7. Save the trained index to a directory named "Modelo".

## Interactive Chatbot (predict.py)

The `predict.py` script allows interacting with the chatbot to receive generated responses based on the previously trained index. Here is a summary of the key steps in the process:

1. Load the trained index from the "Modelo" directory.
2. Create a query engine from the loaded index.
3. Define a `chatbot` function that queries the index and generates responses.
4. Create a graphical interface using the `gradio` library.
5. Users can input questions and receive responses generated by the chatbot.
